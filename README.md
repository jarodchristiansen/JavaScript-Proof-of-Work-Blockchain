# JavaScript Proof of Work Blockchain

This project is a minimalistic blockchain implemented in JavaScript, showcasing a basic Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism and block creation. This includes a basic token, wallets, and consensus mechanism using SHA-256 hashing. 

Minimalistic version of Bitcoin blockchain (without UTXO) utilizing JavaScript rather than C++

## Features
- Block creation and chaining
- Proof-of-Work mining algorithm
- Basic wallet implementation for transactions
- Basic token implementation

## Tech Stack
- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- PubNub for offline/online block transmission for network consensus

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repo_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Start the blockchain:** `node index.js`
